# Purpose of the project

University project.
This django project is a small e-commerce about manga and anime (I called it MangaStore).
I tried to make it like a real store website but it doesn't have some 'real' features:

- Payment system is a fake one, for example it doesn't check the card number.
- Not-in-stock products doesn't exist for simplicity reasons.


# Dependencies

I used poetry virtual environment 1.1.14 version; It is not mandatory to use this venv.
If you check in the pyproject.toml file You will see all the dependencies I used.
If You don't know how to use or download poetry please follow the instructions in [Poetry guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
After installing poetry you simply have to run this commands:
`py -m poetry init`, this is to init the project in poetry environment
`py -m poetry install`, this is to install all the dependencies and to create the environment

If something goes wrong please check the Poetry documentation or other sites that can help You.



# Running the project

After installing all the dependencies You can finally try to run the project.
I do that by doing:
`cd core`, this is to be sure I am in the right directory where I put *manage.py*
`py -m poetry run py -m manage runserver`, this is to run the server

I must use *py -m* before poetry because my OS doesn't recognize the command *poetry*, if You don't seem
to have this problem You can simply use poetry at the begginning of the command.
Notice that if You are in the poetry shell, the project won't be able to run.
Notice that py -m manage is used instead of py manage.py, to see the differences go to the [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html).

After this point You should be able to see the website in the following internet [page](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
If You want to use one of the already-made-user You can find the accounts (with passwords ad fake email) in the account.txt file.
